# Here are some of the projects that I have worked on in C++ Programming languages
Personal Web Page Generator

Write a program that asks the user for his or her name, then asks the user to enter a sentence that describes himself or herself.  Below is an example of the program's screen.

Enter your name:   Julie Taylor [ENTER]
Describe yourself:  I am a computer science major, a member of the Jazz club, and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I graduate. [ENTER]

Once the user has entered the requested input, the program should create an HTML file, containing the input, for a simple webpage.  The file should be named FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.HTML substituting your first and last name (ex. John Doe, John_Doe.HTML).  Below is an example of the HTML content, using the sample input previously shown:

<html>
<head>FIRSTNAME 's Webpage</head>
<body>
     <center>
          <h1>Julie Taylor</h1>
     </center>
     <hr />
     I am a computer science major, a member of the Jazz club, and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I graduate.
     <hr />
</body>
</html>

To validate your output file is correct, open it in notepad.exe or any text editor.  You can also double click on the .HTML file and it should open as a webpage in your browser.
